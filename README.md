## Hello World!

My name is **Avijeet Diwaker** and I'm a software developer.
I currently work on backend development for web applications and PaaS platform tools. I specialize in Python and have professional experience working with Django and Typescript. I'm also looking to learn more about NLP technologies. I intend to use this as more or less a place to record any side projects that I'm working on. Take a look at my work or get in touch! 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React Framework and have built two projects around it.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Issues with new technologies like Microsoft Dapr, and more.

âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that there is no ***type(function)*** in python even though there is a built-in class ***function***. To type-check a function, **Callable** needs to be imported from **typing** module.
